title: Actions
---

Actions form the core of interacting with a Denali application. They are the
controller layer in the MVC architecture, taking in incoming requests,
performing business logic, and handing off to the view or serializer to send the
response.

When a request comes in, Denali's [Router](latest/guides/application/routing) will map the method
and URL to a particular Action. It will invoke the `respond()` method on that
class, which is where your application logic lives:

```js
import ApplicationAction from './application';

export default class ShowPost extends ApplicationAction {

  respond({ params }) {
    return this.db.find('post', params.id);
  }

}
```

## The respond method

Your `respond()` method is where you perform any business logic, query the
database, invoke services such as a mailer, and more.

When you are ready to send a response to the inbound HTTP request, you can
invoke `this.render()`. In it's simplest form, it will simple respond with a
200 status code and an empty response body:

```js
this.render();
// HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

You can customize the status code using the first argument:

```js
this.render(204)
// HTTP/1.1 204 Accepted
```

To send some data in the response body, pass that data in as the second argument:

```js
this.render(200, post);
// HTTP/1.1 200 OK
// <...serialized post...>
```

The above scenario is common enough (respond with HTTP 200 and some data) that
Denali provides a shortcut: just return the data (or a promise that resolves
with that data) from your respond method:

```js
respond() {
  return this.db.find('post', 1);
}
// is the same as:
respond() {
  let post = this.db.find('post', 1);
  this.render(200, post);
}
```

> **Actions as controllers**

> Actions are probably a bit different than most controllers you might be used to.
> Rather than a single controller class that handles multiple different HTTP
> endpoints, Actions represent just one endpoint (HTTP method + URL).

> This might seem like overkill at first, but it enables powerful declarative
> abstractions now that there is a 1:1 relationship between a class and
> endpoint, as you'll see soon.

## Parameters, request body, and query strings

An inbound HTTP request carries several different types of data that you might
want to access in your action's responder method. Denali makes each of these
types of data available under a single object, passed as the sole argument to
your responder method. Combined with destructuring syntax, this lets you quickly
and easily get to the data you need:

```js
respond({ body, params, query, headers }) {
  // body - the inbound HTTP request body
  // params - parameters extracted from dynamic url segments, i.e. /posts/:id -> params.id
  // query - query params parsed from the querystring, i.e. /posts?sort=id -> query.sort === 'id'
  // headers - the HTTP headers from the request
}
```

This object is the return value of the Parser that was used to parse the
incoming request. Parsers should return at least the above properties, but may
add additional fields as well. For example, the JSON-API parser adds a
`included` property containing any sideloaded records sent with the primary data
in the request body.

## Filters

Actions also support the concept of before and after filters. These are methods
that run before or after your responder method. Before filters also have the
ability to render a response and abort the rest of the action handling (i.e.
skip subsequent before filters and the responder).

To add a filter, simply add the method name to the static `before` or `after` array on your
 Action:

```js
class CreatePurchase extends Action {

  static before = [
    'authenticateUser',
    'confirmBalance'
  ];
  static after = 'trackPurchase';

  authenticateUser() {
    // makes sure the user is logged in
  }

  confirmBalance() {
    // make sure the user has money to make the purchase
  }

  trackPurchase() {
    // log the purchase in an analytics tool - we do this as an after filter
    // because there is no reason why this would block the actual purchase
  }

}
```

Filters are inherited from parent classes and mixins. This lets you combine and
reuse sets of filters, either through a base class or a mixin. For example, want
to authenticate all requests against your API? Just add an authentication before
filter to your base ApplicationAction, and it will run on all requests:

```js
class ApplicationAction extends Action {

  static before = [ 'authenticate' ];

  authenticate() {
    // This will run before all actions
  }

}
```

Here we can start to see the power that comes from modeling endpoints with a
single class rather than multiple endpoints per class.

Imagine we have an app where _most_ of our routes need authentication, but a
handful don't. We could use a mixin to apply authentication to only the routes
that need it:

```js
class ApplicationAction extends Action.mixin(Authenticate) {
}
```

But now we need to remember to include that mixin every time. Forget once, and
you've exposed your app to attackers.

Instead, lets make authentication the default, but allow actions to opt out:

```js
class ApplicationAction extends Action {

  static before = [ 'authenticate' ];

  authenticate() {
    // This allows individual actions to "opt-out" of authentication by setting
    // `protected = false;`
    if (this.protected !== false) {
      // authenticate the user
    }

  }

}
```

Here, we add authentication to our base ApplicationAction class, which all our
actions will extend from. This ensures that every action will automatically
require authentication.

But we also check the `this.protected` flag, which lets an individual action
opt out of authentication if needed, but in an explicit manner. Much better!

Filters behave much like responders: they receive the request data argument, and if
they return any value other than null, undefined, or a Promise that resolves
something other than null or undefined, Denali will halt the request processing
and attempt to render that value as the response.

> **Note:** this means that you should take extra care with the return values of
> your filter methods. Accidentally returning a value will cause the request
> processing to halt prematurely, and Denali will attempt to render that value!
