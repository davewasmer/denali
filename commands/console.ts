          Welcome to the Denali console!

          This is a fully interactive REPL for your Denali app. That means normal JavaScript works
          here. Your application is loaded (but not started) in the background, allowing you to
          inspect the runtime state of your app.

          The following variables are availabe:

          * ${ chalk.underline('application') } - an instance of your Application class
          * ${ chalk.underline('container') } - shortcut to application.container. Use this to
            lookup the various classes associated with your app (i.e. actions, models, etc)
        `);
        this.displayPrompt();
      }
    });
  }

}
