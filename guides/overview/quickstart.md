# Getting Started

It's that ever-favorite first project for a server side framework: let's build a basic blogging application!



## Installation

First off, make sure you install Denali globally via npm:

```sh
$ npm install -g denali-cli denali
```



## Scaffolding our application

> Note: Denali requires you to use Node 6.0 or greater.

Next, let's use Denali's handy scaffolding tools to create a blank slate for us to start from:

```sh
$ denali new blog
create blog/.babelrc
create blog/.editorconfig
create blog/.env
create blog/.eslintignore
create blog/.eslintrc
create blog/.gitattributes
create blog/.nvmrc
create blog/.travis.yml
create blog/CHANGELOG.md
create blog/README.md
create blog/app/actions/application.js
create blog/app/actions/index.js
create blog/app/application.js
create blog/app/index.js
create blog/app/models/application.js
create blog/app/serializers/application.js
create blog/app/services/.gitkeep
create blog/config/environment.js
create blog/config/initializers/.gitkeep
create blog/config/middleware.js
create blog/config/routes.js
create blog/denali-build.js
create blog/.gitignore
create blog/package.json
create blog/test/.eslintrc
create blog/test/acceptance/index-test.js
create blog/test/helpers/.gitkeep
create blog/test/unit/.gitkeep
âœ” Dependencies installed
âœ” Git repo initialized
ðŸ“¦  blog created!

To launch your application, just run:

  $ cd blog && denali server

```

Go ahead and follow that last instruction:

```sh
$ cd blog
$ denali server
âœ” blog build complete (1.829s)
[2017-01-12T17:36:52.437Z] INFO - blog@0.0.1 server up on port 3000
```

Perfect! You've got your first Denali app up and running. Now let's see it in action. Hit the root endpoint with curl:

```sh
$ curl localhost:3000
{
   "message": "Welcome to Denali!"
}
```

> **Heads up!** Notice that we didn't visit that localhost URL in the browser. That's because Denali is designed to build **APIs** rather than HTML rendering applications. If you are looking for Node framework to build a server rendered web application, you might want to try something like Sails.js or Express.

Great, we got an app up and running! Now that's cool, but it's not _that_ cool. Let's crack open the scaffolded code to see how we got that welcome message, and how to add our own code.


### Directory structure

The `denali new` command did a lot of setup for us. It created the following directory structure:

```txt
blog/
  app/
    actions/
      application.js
      index.js
    models/
      application.js
    serializers/
      application.js
    services/
    application.js
    index.js
  config/
    initializers/
    environment.js
    middleware.js
    routes.js
  test/
    acceptance/
      index-test.js
    helpers/
    unit/
    .eslintrc
  .babelrc
  .editorconfig
  .env
  .eslintignore
  .eslintrc
  .gitattributes
  .gitignore
  .nvmrc
  .travis.yml
  CHANGELOG.md
  denali-build.js
  package.json
  README.md
```

There's a lot there, but for now, let's open up the `config/routes.js` to see how that root endpoint is being handled:

```js
// config/routes.js
export default function drawRoutes(router) {

  router.get('/', 'index');

}
```

This should look somewhat familiar if you used frameworks like Rails before. The `router.get('/', 'index')` method tells Denali to respond to `GET /` with the `index` action.

In `app/actions/index.js`, we can see how that is handled:

```js
// app/actions/index.js
import ApplicationAction from './application';

export default class IndexAction extends ApplicationAction {

  serializer = false;

  respond() {
    return { message: 'Welcome to Denali!' };
  }

}
```

Let's break down what's going on here:

  * `import ApplicationAction from './application';` - we import the `ApplicationAction` to use as our common base class. You could import the base `Action` class from the `denali` module directly, but having a base class for all actions in your app is handy (and common convention).

  * `serializer = false` - this tells Denali to skip the serializer when rendering the response. More on this in a bit, but for now, it basically means Denali will simply `JSON.stringify()` your response.

  * `respond()` - the `respond()` method is the meat of any action. It defines how the action responds to an incoming request.

  * `return { ... }` - Denali will respond to the incoming request with whatever you return from the `respond()` method. If you return a promise (or mark the method as async via `async respond() { ... }`), Denali will respond with the resolved value of that promise.

The end result here is an action which will always respond with the same JSON object that we saw above: `{ "message": "Welcome to Denali!" }`.

## Adding a resource

Now let's get a bit more creative. Our blog API is going to need to store and retrieve our blog posts. Let's create a `post` resource to enable that.

> Normally, you'd probably store these in some kind of database (i.e. Mongo, Postgres, MySQL, etc). Denali is **database agnostic** though. So for now, we'll use plain ol' JS objects (a.k.a. POJOs). But you can easily substitute your own models in later. For more details, check out the [Data guides](../../data/models).

To start, let's use that handy scaffolding tool again:

```sh
$ denali generate resource post
```

This scaffold creates several files:

  * A set of **actions** in `app/actions/posts/` for this resource with the basic CRUD operations stubbed out. These files are where you'll implement your application logic to respond to a particular request. We saw these above.

  * A **serializer** to determine how your posts will be rendered in the response. We'll learn more about this in a bit.

  * A **model** to represent your posts.

  * A placeholder **acceptance test suite** for this resource. Denali comes with a first-class testing environment ready to go.

If we open up `app/actions/posts/list.js` now, you can see the stubbed out actions:

```js
  // app/actions/posts/list.js
  export default class ListPosts extends ApplicationAction {
    respond() {
      return new Errors.NotImplemented();
    }
  }
```

Let's go ahead and implement that list action now. We'll just hardcode the posts into the response for now:

```js
// app/controllers/posts.js

  serializer = false;

  respond() {
    return ([
      {
        id: 1,
        title: 'Denali is awesome'
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        title: 'You are awesome!'
      }
      ]);
  }
```

Great! Let's hit that endpoint now:

```sh
$ curl localhost:3000/posts
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Denali is awesome"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "You are awesome!"
  }
]
```

## Adding a database

Hardcoded JSON still isn't all that interesting. Let's integrate with a data store so consumers of the API can actually manipulate the data.

##### A quick diversion about how Denali handles models and data

Denali takes a somewhat unique approach. Most frameworks ship with some kind of Object Relational Mapper (ORM) baked right in. It transforms rows from a database into objects you can manipulate.

Here's the thing: **ORMs are hard. _Really hard._** To make matters worse, there's **no generally accepted "good" ORM for Node.js**.

With this in mind, Denali purposefully **does not ship with an ORM**. Instead, Denali's Models are essentially a thin adapter layer that lets you plug your own ORM in instead.

There's lots of reasons why this is a powerful approach, but those are covered in the Data guides. For now, let's forge ahead and setup our data store.

### The Memory Adapter

Denali ships with an in-memory data store and ORM adapter, which can be useful for testing and debugging use cases. It's the default ORM for newly scaffolded projects, so it's already setup and ready to go. We'll use it now to get going without needing to setup an actual database.

### ORM Adapters

The provided memory adapter should not be used for production applications - data will not be saved across server restarts, and the performance is likely quite poor.

When you are ready to integrate with a database, take a look at the various [ORM adapters available for Denali](../../data/orm-adapters) for details on installing and configuring each.

## Adding a model

The resource generator we ran above already added a blank Post model for us in `app/models/post.js`. Let's open that up, and add a `title` attribute so we can store the title of each blog post:

```js

import { attr /* , hasOne, hasMany */ } from 'denali';
import ApplicationModel from './application';

export default class Post extends ApplicationModel {

  static title = attr('text'); // <- add this

}
```

Okay, let's break this one down. First up, we follow the same pattern of having
a base "Application" class that we did with Actions. We also import the `attr()` helper from Denali, which is used to define an attribute on the model:

```js
import { attr /* , hasOne, hasMany */ } from 'denali';
import ApplicationModel from './application';
```

Next, we create our `title` attribute. Two things to note here:

1. Here, and elsewhere, Denali makes heavy use of the class properties syntax, and,
2. Attributes are declared as static properties

```js
  static title = attr('text');
```

Now, back in our actions, we can see that the resource scaffold added code that will lookup all posts via `Post.find()`. Because `Post.find()` returns a promise that will resolve with the posts from the database, we can simply return that call to `Post.find()` directly from our respond method. Denali will automatically wait for the returned promise to resolve, and will then render the resulting value:

```js
// app/actions/posts/list.js
  respond() {
    let Post = this.modelFor('post');
    return Post.find();
  }
```

Over in our create action, we can let the user create new blog posts too:

```js
// app/actions/posts/create.js
  respond(params) {
    let Post = this.modelFor('post');
    return Post.create(params);
  }
```

Great! Now we can create and list all the Posts in our in-memory data store.
Let's test it out:

```sh
$ curl localhost:3000/posts -X POST -d '{"title": "My first post!"}'

{
  "id": 1
}
```

Looks like our Post was created! But if we look closely - our post's title (`"My first post!"`) wasn't returned. And if we check the post listing endpoint (`GET /posts`):

```sh
$ curl localhost:3000/posts

[
  {
    "id": 1
  }
]
```

**It's missing there too. What's going on here?**

## Working with Serializers

The reason our `title` field was missing was because we didn't tell Denali that we wanted it returned. We do this with serializers.

In Denali, a serializer takes a payload object (or array), and transforms it into the string of JSON to send back in the response.

By default, serializers are configured with a whitelist of allowed attributes. Since we haven't touched our `post` serializer yet, the `title` attribute isn't in that whitelist, so it gets stripped out of all our responses by default.

Let's fix that now by adding it to the whitelist:

```js
// app/serializers/post.js
import ApplicationSerializer from './application';

export default class PostSerializer extends ApplicationSerializer {

  attributes = [ 'title' ];

}
```

And now let's try to list the posts again:

```sh
$ curl localhost:3000/posts

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "My first post!"
  }
]
```

There it is! Our blog is off to a promising start.
