/**
 * The ORMAdapter class is responsible for enabling Denali to communicate with
 * the ORM of your choice. It does this by boiling down the possible actions
 * that a user might before against a Model that would involve persistence into
 * a set of basic operations. Your adapter then implements these operations,
 * and Denali can build on top of that.
 *
 * Most of the values passed between your application code and the underlying
 * ORM are opaque to Denali. This means that Denali has no idea what that
 * `query` object looks like or does - it just blindly hands it off to your
 * ORM adapter, which can plug it into the ORM interface appropriately.
 *
 * Most instance-level methods are given a reference to the Denali Model
 * instance that is being acted upon. Most ORM adapters will use that model
 * instance to access `model.record`, which is the slot used to store the
 * instance of the ORM's record. However, the full Model instance is supplied
 * to provide the adapter with maximum flexibility.
 *
 * The ORM adapter interface was designed to be a high enough abstraction that
 * most data stores should support most of the operations. However, it is not
 * required that an adapter support all of the operations - for example, not
 * all data stores support changing a record's ID. In those cases, the adapter
 * method may simply throw.
